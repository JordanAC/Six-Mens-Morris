Six-Mens-Morris
===============
A heuristic game of Six Mens Morris written in LISP with a textual representation. This is a project from my Artificial Intelligence class.

Six Mens Morris is a strategy board game for two players. Getting three in a row forces an oppenent to remove 
a piece from the game. The object is to get your oppenent down to two pieces or prevent them from making a 
legal move.
